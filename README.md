## What is this?
I just wanted to give these 3d diagrams in pure html & css a go. <br/>
This is just a simple demo. You can test it by cloning repo, then npx serve. <br/>
You'll notice there is a js file and a package.json, you don't really need those.

If you want to learn more there is a good tutorial at [spinning-diagrams-with-css](https://x.st/spinning-diagrams-with-css/).
